### Cole Conte's Github
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about experimental design (my last course in my MS program @ Stony Brook) and deep learning (through the popular Andrew Ng series of courses). <br>
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a full time role in data science in the NYC/central NJ area, or remotely. <br>
âœ¨ I'm most experienced in Python (my first language) and R (which I use for most of the work in my MS). I also have repos on here from past projects in Javascript, Swift, and Java, and have experience in many other languages, from C and C++ to Matlab. <br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I ran track and cross country in undergrad @ Bucknell! My profile picture is from a training session with our 800m runners. <br>
