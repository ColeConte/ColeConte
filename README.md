### Cole Conte Github
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a fantasy football visualization app (using R Shiny) to get ready for the upcoming season!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about experimental design (my last course in my MS program @ Stony Brook) and deep learning (through the popular Andrew Ng series of courses).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects involving sports/sports gambling and financial research, and am also interested in ML algorithm performance and optimization and data science interview prep.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a full time role in data science in the NYC/central NJ area, or remotely.
- âœ¨ I'm most experienced in Python (my first language) and R (which I use for most of the work in my MS). I also have repos on here from past projects in Javascript, Swift, and Java, and have experience in many other languages, from C and C++ to Matlab. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I ran track and cross country in undergrad @ Bucknell! My profile picture is from a training session with our 800m runners.
